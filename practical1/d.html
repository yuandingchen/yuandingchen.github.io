        <dd> Semanticized HTML is a way to write HTML, which emphasizes the meaning of encoded information above its format. HTML has included semantic tags [69] since its inception, but also includes iconic tags such as font, i and center tags. There are also some semantically neutral span and div tags. Since CSS began to be applied to most browsers in the late 1990s, web page makers have been encouraged to use CSS to separate presentation from content.
        Representational tags are not encouraged in current HTML and XHTML recommendations. Most representation functions in the old version of HTML are no longer allowed to be used because they lead to poor accessibility, higher site maintenance costs, and larger document size.</dd></dl>
