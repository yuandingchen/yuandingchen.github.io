            Using the latest standards can help developers make better use of new features and functions to improve development efficiency and user experience. For example, take video playback as an example, HTML5 supports playing videos directly on web pages without using Flash or other plug-ins. This means that users can play videos seamlessly on different devices, while avoiding security and compatibility issues.</dd></dl></article>
